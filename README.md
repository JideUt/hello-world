# hello-world
In the beginning...

There was a dreamer. He wanted to be important, respected, and powerful.
He seeked happiness... never able to find it.
He got lost in short term fixes. He hit rock bottom.

He seeks retribution. Absolution.
Redemption.


Just kidding. Just don't know what to do and programming feels like the right fit for what I want in life.
I'm going to give it everything in the gas tank.
All I want in return is a new skill and a new world to explore.

#Times may be subject to change. Hopefully sooner rather than later but I understand that this is a process that can take much longer than the timeline I have set out. This is my reminder to remember where I came from. Remember where I plan to be. And remember what the price of admission is. Lastly, I need to remember who I am and what I am capable of.
